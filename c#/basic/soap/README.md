# webPDF Basic SOAP Sample for C#

This sample shows the use of the SOAP web service from C#.

## Usage
The C# samples are build with the [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/de/vs/) IDE.
You can directly open and run the projects from inside the IDE. For other IDEs you have to import the projects.

## Instructions
- Open the project/solution file **'webPDFWebServiceTest.sln'** in the [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/de/vs/) 
IDE or import the project into your preferred IDE. 

- Build the project from the IDE ('Build -> Build Solution' or 'Ctrl+Shift+B').

- Select the solution configuration and debug ('F5') or start ('Ctrl+F5') the application.

> Note: This sample project requires a local running webPDF server listening on port 8080.
